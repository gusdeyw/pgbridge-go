# Security Improvements and Best Practices

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in PGBridge-Go and provides recommendations for production deployment.

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Authentication Security
- **Fixed**: Replaced plain text password comparison with bcrypt hashing
- **Added**: Constant-time password comparison to prevent timing attacks
- **Added**: Rate limiting for authentication attempts (5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP)
- **Added**: Input validation for username and password lengths
- **Added**: Proper password strength requirements

### 2. Credential Management
- **Removed**: Hardcoded plain text credentials
- **Added**: Bcrypt-hashed default admin credentials
- **Added**: Environment variable support for admin credentials
- **Added**: Secure credential loading mechanism

### 3. Input Validation
- **Added**: Comprehensive input validation for user registration
- **Added**: Username format validation (alphanumeric, underscore, dash only)
- **Added**: Password complexity requirements
- **Added**: Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

### 4. Security Headers
- **Added**: Complete security headers middleware including:
  - X-Frame-Options (DENY) - prevents clickjacking
  - X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff) - prevents MIME type sniffing
  - X-XSS-Protection - enables browser XSS protection
  - Content-Security-Policy - controls resource loading
  - Referrer-Policy - controls referrer information
  - Permissions-Policy - restricts browser features

### 5. Dependency Updates
- **Updated**: All dependencies to latest secure versions
- **Resolved**: Known vulnerability issues in outdated packages

## Production Security Checklist

### Required Actions Before Production:

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure password hash:
   go run -c "package main; import \"golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt\"; import \"fmt\"; func main() { hash, _ := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(\"YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD\"), bcrypt.DefaultCost); fmt.Println(string(hash)) }"
   ```
   Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` environment variables.

2. **Generate Secure Master Key**
   ```bash
   # Generate a 32-byte encryption key:
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
   Set the `MASTER_KEY` environment variable.

3. **Enable HTTPS**
   - Uncomment the Strict-Transport-Security header in `security_headers.go`
   - Use a reverse proxy like Nginx with SSL certificates
   - Update Content-Security-Policy to use 'https:' sources only

4. **Database Security**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict database access to application only
   - Enable database connection encryption (SSL/TLS)
   - Regular database backups

5. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use proper secret management in production
   - Rotate credentials regularly

### Additional Security Recommendations:

1. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive logging for security events
   - Monitor for suspicious authentication attempts
   - Set up alerts for security violations

2. **Network Security**
   - Use firewalls to restrict access
   - Implement DDoS protection
   - Use VPN for administrative access

3. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Scan for dependency vulnerabilities regularly
   - Perform periodic security assessments
   - Keep dependencies up to date

4. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Regular encrypted backups
   - Test backup restoration procedures
   - Document incident response procedures

## Environment Variables Configuration

```bash
# Required for production
MASTER_KEY=your_32_byte_hex_key_here
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your_bcrypt_hashed_password

# Database (use strong credentials)
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=secure_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=secure_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name

# Application
APP_PORT=5000
DEFAULT_CALLBACK=https://yourdomain.com/callback
```
